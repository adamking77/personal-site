I navigate the intersections where most specialists fear to tread. Since 2017, I've been slow-traveling across 19 countries, absorbing cultural perspectives that inform how I help clients solve their most complex challenges.

While the world pushes for narrow specialization, I've embraced the power of being a Generalized Specialist. This allows me to spot connections others miss and create solutions that wouldn't emerge from a single discipline.

I don't just solve problemsâ€”I transform them into opportunities by bringing together disparate elements most would never think to combine.

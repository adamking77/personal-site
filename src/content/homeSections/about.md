I'm a developer, hiker, and coffee enthusiast based in Boulder, CO. I'm currently crafting web experiences at Oxbow UI as a frontend engineer. Previously, I honed my skills at Airbnb, and beyond my 9-to-5, I've been collaborating with indie makers, close friends, and tinkering on side projects. This little corner of the web is my personal hub, a mix of 80% experiments and 20% musings about life and work.

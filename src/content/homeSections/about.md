While this modern age keeps pushing us into increasingly narrowed specialization, I embrace the power of being a Generalized Specialist.

A Generalized Specialist builds depth in a central area of expertise, while incorporating functional and useful knowledge and resources from other disciplines.

Generalized Specialists are radical solutionists who transform problems into opportunities by bringing together these seemingly disparate elements most would never think to combine.

This allows me to spot connections others miss and create solutions that wouldn't emerge from a narrowly-focused discipline.

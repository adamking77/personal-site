Modern culture keeps pushing us towards narrow specialization. I embrace being a Generalized Specialist instead.

A Generalized Specialist builds depth in a central area of expertise while incorporating knowledge and resources from other disciplines.

Generalized Specialists are Solutionists to the core. We transform problems into opportunities by bringing together disparate elements most would never think to combine.

This allows me to spot connections others miss and create solutions that wouldn't emerge from narrowly-focused disciplines.

I run [GenZen](https://genzenhq.com), a company dedicated to restoring human agency in this age of systematic exploitation.

As founder and chief strategist, I discover and design solutions for overlooked and underserved groups who remain frequent targets of exploitation.

We also release [products and resources](https://graph-zen.app) that further your autonomy in your current pursuits.

[Autonomy Intelligence](https://genzenhq.com/autonomy-intelligence) is the core framework GenZen applies to every opportunity and initiative. It's about understanding how power gets systematically removed from individuals, organizations, and cultures, then engineering the restoration of that power.

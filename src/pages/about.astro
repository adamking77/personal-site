          Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside
          down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you
          how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
          <br />
          <br />
          In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent
          most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin'
          some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to
          no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight
          and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle
          in Bel-Air"
          <br />
          <br />
          I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase
          and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
          I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
          <br />
          <br />
          But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of
          place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when
          I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
          <br />
          <br />
          Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked
          like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested
          yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
          I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh"
          and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was
          rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
